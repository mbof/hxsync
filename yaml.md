# YAML configuration file format

You can edit device configuration using a YAML file. This makes it easier to
share configuration across devices, and provides access to more device settings.

The HX890 and HX891BT radios have the most supported features. Most of these
features also work on HX870. A smaller set of features is supported by the
fixed-mount GX1400. For a list of features supported by device, see
[this table](README.md#feature-support-matrix).

## Example

## Reference documentation

Only the directives provided will be written.

### `individual_directory`

Provide the directory of MMSI numbers to be used for DSC individual calls. MMSIs
must be wrapped in quotes.

Example:

```
- individual_directory:
    - Boat 1: "123456789"
    - Boat 2: "987654321"
    - USCG DSC test: "003669999"
```

### `group_directory`

Provide the directory of MMSIs to be used for DSC group calls. MMSIs must be
wrapped in quotes.

Example:

```
- group_directory:
    - Friends: "012345678"
    - Work: "087654321"
```

### `waypoints`

Provide the directory of waypoints used for routing. Coordinates can be provided
in "DMM" (degrees and decimal minutes, the device's native format) or in decimal
degrees.

Example:

```
- waypoints:
    - Alpha: 33.9803 -118.4517     # Decimal degrees
    - Bravo: 33N58.818 118W27.102  # Degrees and decimal minutes
```

### `routes`

Provide routes as a series of waypoints, referred to by their names. The first
waypoint in the route is first in the list. A `waypoints` section must define
the waypoint names first.

Example:

```
- routes:
    - A first route:
        - Alpha
        - Bravo
    - Another route:
        - Bravo
        - Alpha
```

### `channels`

Set channel configuration for the current channel group, including:

- `intership`: list of channels enabled for inter-ship calling (DSC). If this
  section is omitted, the list of channels enabled for inter-ship calling is
  left unchanged. If it is present, then all channels for inter-ship calling
  must be provided (other channels will be disabled for inter-ship calling).
- `names`: channel names. If this section is omitted, names are unchanged; if a
  channel is omitted from this list, its name is unchanged too.
- `scrambler`: (HX890 and HX891BT only) scrambler settings. If this section is
  omitted, scrambler settings are unchanged; if this section is present, all
  scrambler settings must be provided (other channels with have scrambling
  disabled). For each channel in this section, the scrambler setting consists
  of:
  - a scrambler `type` of either 4 or 32, depending on whether the 4-code
    scrambler (CVS2500) or 32-code scrambler (FVP-42) should be used
  - a scrambler `code` between 0 and `type` - 1.

Example:

```
- channels:
    current_group:
        intership: [ 6, 13, 68, 69, 71, 72, 1078 ]
        names:
            - 9: Foo-CALLING
            - 12: Bar-VTS
        scrambler:
            - 88: { type: 4, code: 3 }
```

The configuration can also be provided explicitly for channel groups `group_1`,
`group_2` and `group_3`.
