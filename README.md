# HxSync

This project is an Angular web application that connects to the Standard Horizon
HX870 and HX890 portable VHF radios using the WebSerial API. As of this writing,
the WebSerial API is only available in Chrome, and this software only supports
the following functions:

- Reading and editing waypoints
- Downloading the GPS log as a GPX file

It is very incomplete, and could break your device. **Use at your own risk!**

This software builds on the work published at
[Robert Elsinga's page on the HX890](https://pc5e.nl/info/standard-horizon-hx890e-marine-handheld)
as well as the [`hxtool` Python utility](https://github.com/cr/hx870) by
Christiane Ruetten.

## Development server

Run `ng serve --serve-path hx` for a dev server. Navigate to
`http://localhost:4200/hx`. The application will automatically reload if you
change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can
also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the
`dist/` directory.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via
[Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).
