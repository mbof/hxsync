# SHsync

This project lets users program Standard Horizon VHF marine radios from their
browser. It is an Angular web application that works with the Standard Horizon
HX870, HX890, HX891BT, and GX1400 VHF radios. While it has been tested by many
users, it is not provided by Standard Horizon. Use is at your own risk!

Features:

- Edit waypoints, routes, MMSI directories for DSC, and channel configuration
- Edit with a UI or as a [YAML file](yaml.md)
- Edit device settings and FM presets
- Share a configuration as a link for others to apply to their device
- Backup and restore DAT files
- Available offline via a progressive web app

Requires Chrome, Edge, or Opera (due to availability of the
[WebSerial API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Web_Serial_API#browser_compatibility)
and
[File System Access API](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/capabilities/web-apis/file-system-access#read-file)).

## Developer setup

### Run locally

First-time installation: after cloning this repository, run `npm install` from
the project directory to fetch the required modules, and run `npm run prebuild`
to generate required version files.

Run `ng serve --serve-path /hx` for a dev server. Navigate to
`http://localhost:4200/hx`. The application will automatically reload if you
change any of the source files.

There is a second app entry point for the share page. It can be started with
`ng serve share --serve-path /hx/share` and accessed at
`http://localhost:4200/hx/share`.

### Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can
also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

### Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via
[Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

### Build

Run `npm run build -- --base-href=/hx/` to build the project. The build
artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.

### Text formatting

Run
`npx prettier --write $(git diff HEAD --name-only | egrep '\.(ts|html|css|md)$')`
to format files before committing.
